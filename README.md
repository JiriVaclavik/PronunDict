(wildcard search by pronunciation)


# PronunDict
PronunDict is a pronunciation dictionary of American English for Windows. This dictionary can search reversely by pronunciation or normally by spelling. It uses [CMUdict](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) as its data source. Pronunciation is transcribed in [IPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) symbols.

The original project page is on [SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pronundict/).

## Warning
In spite of the best efforts, this dictionary is not flawless. Unfortunately, there are some
errors in the dictionary entries. Also, marking of stressed syllables does not always work
perfectly, but it is improved in this version (based on a set of possible syllable onsets).
