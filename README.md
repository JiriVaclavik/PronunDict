# PronunDict
PronunDict is both a reverse phonetic dictionary (searching by pronunciation) and a standard one to search by spelling. Pronunciation is transcribed in IPA symbols. The software runs on Windows, and should also work with Wine on Linux and macOS.

NEW VERSION 0.4 RELEASED!

## Acknowledgement
This software uses two external dictionaries (bundled with it):
1. [AmEPD](https://github.com/rhdunn/amepd) -- the American English Pronunciation Dictionary by Reece H. Dunn
2. [CMUdict](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict) -- the Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing Dictionary

## Features
* search by pronunciation
* search by spelling
* IPA symbols
* auto lookup through clipboard
* load custom dictionaries
* wildcard search by spelling or pronunciation (e.g. for finding rhymes)
* preview while typing
* anagrams
* phonetic keyboard

## Warning
Unfortunately, this dictionary is not flawless. There are some errors in the dictionary entries. Also, marking of stressed syllables does not always work perfectly, because syllable boundaries are only guessed based on a set of possible syllable onsets.

## License
This program is freeware. Redistribution is permitted provided that it is free of charge.

## Notes
* Currently, the source code is not publicly available, but you can download the binaries (see the releases).
* You can follow [PronunDict on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PronunDict).
* The original project page is on [SourceForge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pronundict/).
